#### Editing Java

In the Nautical-Ranks-V2-JAVA Folder go to assets -> minecraft --> textures --> ranks and put your rank image in there. Next go out of ranks folder and back to the minecraft folder but this time go into fonts and edit the default.json file. Once you have got into that file copy and paste the second to last bitmap in the file and put it under that one you just copied then rename youtubebyrg.png to what ever png file you put in ranks folder. Then change "chars": ["î Ÿ"] to the symbol you got from the bedrock emoji convertor. Then zip the file.
